# React Meme Generator

This project is a simple React meme generator application that allows users to create custom memes by adding top and bottom text to random images. It demonstrates the use of React's key features like `useState`, `useEffect`, and asynchronous operations with Promises.

## Acknowledgement

This project is based on the concepts taught in the Scrimba course [Scrimba Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact), where I learned about building interactive user interfaces with React.

## Features

- Create memes by adding custom text to random images.
- Utilizes the `useState` hook to manage meme data.
- Fetches a list of memes using the Imgflip API through asynchronous operations.
- Demonstrates the usage of the `useEffect` hook for data fetching on component mount.
- Interactively updates meme text with the `onChange` event handler.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. In the input fields, enter the desired top and bottom text for your meme.
3. Click the "Get a new meme image ðŸ‘¾" button to generate a random meme image with the provided text.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 to create different meme variations.

## Note

This project is intentionally minimal in terms of styling. It serves as a demonstration of key React concepts and functionality without focusing on visual design.
